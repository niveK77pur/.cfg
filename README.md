# Discontinued

Please head over to <https://github.com/niveK77pur/77configs> for my configs. This repository is discontinued.

I restructured the way my config files are managed. In this repository, each file is located where it should be on the system and a git repo in my home directory essentially tracks all of what I tell it to track.

However, installing the configs on a new machine seemed like a bit of a hassle so in the new repository the files are all located in a unified directory. A script then places the files to their locations via symlinks. That way it's also easy to see which files are being tracked and which ones aren't.
